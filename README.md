# Shallow Water Model

This Python program is able to solve the shallow water equations in conservative form in a channel around the Earth between 20째N and 70째N with a spatial resolution of 100 km (around one degree,
default 254x50 grid points). It uses the Lax-Wendroff method. The three prognostic variables are the two wind speeds $`u`$ and $`v`$, and the depth of the fluid layer $`h`$ above a constant
topology $`H`$.

The domain is periodic in the x direction and has solid north and south boundaries where $`v=0`$ and $`h`$ is fixed at its initial values. The domain size
is comparable to the perimeter of a sphere at a latitude of 45째, $`2\pi R_e \cos(45째)\cong`$28,000 km. For the implementation of a rotating Earth,
the beta-plane approximation is used. The results are displayed as an animation of the fluid depth $`h`$ and the relative vorticity $`\eta`$. The inline
animation can be paused with the space bar and viewed frame-by-frame with the arrow keys.

## Usage

Open the script `swe_solver.py` with your preferred Python IDE. You can adjust the values of gravity acceleration $`g`$, mean Coriolis parameter $`f`$,
meridional gradient of Coriolis parameter $`\beta`$, number of longitudinal/latitudinal gridpoints $`n_x`$, $`n_y`$, timestep $`dt`$, time between outputs and
the total simulation time. A switch for initial geostrophic balance or wind at rest and random noise in the initial height field is implemented as well.
For convenience, there is a second script `swe_solver_GUI.py` which uses a simple graphical user interface.


By default, there are nine initial conditions:
- [ ] `UNIFORM_WESTERLY`: initializes a westerly wind with a mean wind speed of 20 m/s
- [ ] `ZONAL_JET`: initializes an idealized Bickley jet, for which $`h \propto \tanh(y-\bar{y})`$
- [ ] `REANALYSIS`: uses a pre-defined potential height field from the ECMWF reanalysis from 1 July 2000 (matlab file `reanalysis.mat`)
- [ ] `GAUSSIAN_BLOB`: initializes a Gaussian-shaped wave on the left side of the domain
- [ ] `STEP`
- [ ] `CYCLONE_IN_WESTERLY`
- [ ] `SHARP_SHEAR`
- [ ] `EQUATORIAL_EASTERLY`: initializes an easterly wind that is proportional to a cosine
- [ ] `SINUSOIDAL`


By default, there are five possible orographies $`H`$:
- [ ] `FLAT`: sets the orography to zero everywhere
- [ ] `SLOPE`
- [ ] `GAUSSIAN_MOUNTAIN`: inserts a Gaussian-shaped mountain in the middle of the domain
- [ ] `EARTH_OROGRAPHY`: uses a pre-defined topology of Earth in the Northern Hemisphere (matlab file `digital_elevation_map.mat`)
- [ ] `SEA_MOUNT`: inserts a Gaussian-shaped sea mount that is 500 m below the surface at its highest point

## Dependencies

To run this program, you will need recent versions of the Python packages `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib` besides the standard Python. Optionally, 
for opening the script `swe_solver_GUI.py` the package `PySimpleGUI` is required.
